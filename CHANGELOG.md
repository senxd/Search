# Changelog

What changes in Search from one version to the next, newest first.

**Unreleased** gathers what is done since the last version, as it lands:
every fix and every addition gets its line the day it is merged. When a
version ships, the section takes its number and date, its gist becomes the
paragraph in `NOTES.md` (what Settings and the updater show), and the list
is what gets posted as the update. What is planned but not done yet lives
in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Unreleased

### Added

- A middle-click on a tab closes it, in the row across the top and in the column. A pinned tab is put down, as with ⌘W. Thanks [@lusqua](https://github.com/lusqua) ([#27](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/27))
- Rename a tab: Rename in a tab's right-click menu, or Tabs › Rename Tab, types a name over the title in place. The name stays with the tab wherever it goes, and survives a quit; emptying the field gives the page's own title back. Thanks [@theosementa](https://github.com/theosementa) ([#32](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/32))
- The sidebar can hide by itself until the pointer reaches the left edge: Settings › Tabs › Hide the sidebar until the pointer reaches the edge. ⌘S still brings it out to stay. Thanks [@lusqua](https://github.com/lusqua) ([#30](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/30))
- Spaces: separate sets of tabs in the one window, each with its own icon and, if you like, its own downloads folder — signed in wherever your other spaces are, or starting afresh with cookies and sign-ins of its own, as you choose when you make it. Turn them on in Settings › Tabs, then switch with ⌃1–⌃9, the space's icon, or two fingers sideways over the column of tabs, where the next space slides in beside this one; past the last, the column offers to make a new one. ([#4](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/issues/4))
- Web Inspector: Inspect Element in a page's right-click menu, and in the View menu the inspector (⌥⌘I), the JavaScript console (⌥⌘J) and picking an element (⌥⌘C), the keys Chrome and Arc use. ([#13](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/issues/13))
- ⌘S folds the sidebar away and the page takes the whole window; the left edge brings the tabs back out. Thanks [@kndpt](https://github.com/kndpt) ([#7](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/7))
- Search with something other than Google: Settings › General › Search with offers DuckDuckGo, Bing, Ecosia, Startpage and Kagi, or any address with `%s` where the words go. Google stays the default. Thanks [@karadoganyi](https://github.com/karadoganyi) ([#43](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/issues/43))
- A skill that teaches coding agents to drive Search with `./bench`. Thanks [@jasonkneen](https://github.com/jasonkneen) ([#14](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/14))
- Tab groups: a run of tabs that stays together, wearing a colour, a name and a symbol of your choice. In the strip a group is a chip where its first tab sits — a click folds the run into it, a right-click opens its menu — and in the column it is a tinted block with a header that does the same. New Tab Group on a tab's right-click starts one, and a tab dragged into or out of a run joins or leaves it; dragging the chip or the header moves the whole run at once. The menu renames a group in place, recolours it from a row of dots, picks its symbol from a grid, opens a fresh tab at the run's end, moves it to a space of its own, saves its tabs as a folder of bookmarks, lets them loose, or closes the group whole — and a group closed whole is one entry in Recently Closed, so ⌘⇧T brings it all back where it stood. Groups belong to the space they were made in and come back after a quit; a pinned tab is a kept place already and never joins one, and a private tab's membership leaves with it. ([#31](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/31))

### Fixed

- Search opens on macOS 14 again: it quit as it opened, before its window, setting the look chosen in Settings on an application that didn't exist yet. Thanks [@serhiitroinin](https://github.com/serhiitroinin) ([#38](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/38))
- A column of more tabs than the window holds scrolls between the pinned tabs and its foot, instead of running under the traffic lights and off the bottom of the window; the tab you go to is brought into view. Thanks [@lusqua](https://github.com/lusqua) ([#39](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/39))
- ⌘T never leaves two empty tabs: an empty tab already open elsewhere in the row comes to its end and opens, with whatever was typed in it and not gone to cleared. ([#35](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/issues/35)) Thanks [@SamarthaB10](https://github.com/SamarthaB10)
- While a tab's address or name is being edited in the tab itself, a click anywhere else — the page, the column below, the rest of the strip — keeps what was typed, as Return does, instead of throwing it away. An address left as it was loads nothing again.
- Folded away with ⌘S and brought out at the edge, the column arrives whole: the traffic lights and the pinned tabs come in with it instead of standing there before it.
- A double-click along the top of the window fills the screen, as a title bar's does: it was answered twice and ended where it started. In the column's mode the page's top edge takes it too, folded away with ⌘S included, where nothing did.
- ⌘← and ⌘→ move through text while editing; adding Shift selects text instead of navigating away from the page. Thanks [@yuxino](https://github.com/yuxino) ([#19](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/19))
- Extensions that open something inside a page no longer make it reload: signing in to Google with iCloud Passwords installed reloaded the page over and over, and every Vimium key that opens its bar or its link hints reloaded the page. Such a panel now gets the same answers from the browser as in Chrome. ([#2](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/issues/2))
- Dragging a tab to put it elsewhere in the row across the top moves the tab, not the whole window, and a tab being dragged stays under the pointer as it passes the others, in the column too.
- A fresh install follows the Mac's appearance: on a Mac set to dark the browser and its pages start out dark, instead of always starting light. Thanks [@mikuteto-dev](https://github.com/mikuteto-dev) ([#22](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/22))
- The address field on a new tab holds still while its suggestions appear under it, instead of jumping up. Thanks [@fschrhunt](https://github.com/fschrhunt) ([#16](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/16))
- 1Password's Sign in button works: an extension's page can send its tab to a website again, where it used to do nothing.
- A video in the floating window costs no more to play than in its tab. The window's shadow made WindowServer composite every frame; it has none now. ([#33](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/issues/33)) Thanks [@AxxzyWasTaken](https://github.com/AxxzyWasTaken)
- Tab moves between a form's fields again, as in every browser; ⌃Tab and ⌃⇧Tab switch tabs.
- ⌘1–⌘9 (and ⌘0 to reset the zoom) work on every keyboard layout, AZERTY included: they follow the key, not the character it types.
- A private tab now leaves nothing behind: it no longer shows up in Recently Closed. Thanks [@yuxino](https://github.com/yuxino) ([#6](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/6))
- ⌘L then Return keeps the whole address, the part after `?` included. Thanks [@yuxino](https://github.com/yuxino) ([#5](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/5))
- A floating video shows the whole picture on YouTube, and the page comes back to its tab when it lands. Thanks [@Chinteyley](https://github.com/Chinteyley) ([#9](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/9))
- No white flash when a link opens a new tab in dark mode. Thanks [@RanaOsamaAsif](https://github.com/RanaOsamaAsif) ([#3](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/pull/3))
- Typing no longer makes the Mac beep when a page hasn't put its cursor in a field yet — starting a reply on X, for one. ([cc8aa58](https://github.com/driceroland/Search/commit/cc8aa58))

## 1.0 — 23 September 2026

The first version. A browser for the Mac with nothing in the way: tabs in a row or down the side, pinned tabs that keep their place, and one field for addresses and searches. Ads blocked before they load, passwords and passkeys in your keychain, anything on a page hidden for good, reading mode, floating video, Chrome extensions from the Chrome Web Store (macOS 15.4 or later), and tabs that sleep after half an hour. 2.9 MB, on the engine already in macOS.
